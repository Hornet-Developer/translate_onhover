Simply the best Google Chrome translation extension - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aggiiclaiamajehmlfpkjmlbadmkledi

Now on Firefox too: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/transover-ff/

### Run local version

You'll need a terminal and NodeJs. Then clone/download this repository.

In the project directory, install dependencies (run this in a terminal):

```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```

Then build:

```
TRACKING_ID=1234 yarn build
```

Where TRACKING\_ID is some Google Analitycs tracking id.

Now you can "Load unpacked" the `./dist` folder.

### Development

In addition to the above, there is `yarn dev`. For as long as it is running, `dist` will stay updated with code changes.
